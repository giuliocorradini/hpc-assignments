# HPC class assignments

Workgroup #7

This repository contains the assignments for High Performance Computing class, and builds on top of the
public laboratory sources repository which is hosted at

[](https://git.hipert.unimore.it/hpc_class/hpc-lab-assignment-repo.git)

Each workgroup must work on a single problem, but building on top of a shared basis implies that this repository
will contain the source for each possible assignment. Our edits will only affect the assigned problem for each
technology.

Submissions with our edits only will be packed in a separate zip and published in the **Release** section.

## OpenMP

Goal: improve the execution time, on a multi-processor system, of the Gram-Schmidt process.

Source code is located at `OpenMP/linear-algebra/solvers/gramschmidt`.
